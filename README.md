# dev-workflow

Role-based development workflow subagents with pluggable PM and notes adapters.

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires the [superpowers plugin](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) to be installed:

```
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

The superpowers plugin provides core methodology skills (TDD, systematic debugging, brainstorming, verification gates, subagent orchestration) that are invoked throughout the dev-workflow skill phases.

## Roles

| Command | Skill | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/start start-development [story-id]` | start-development | Branch, implement with TDD, commit, create PR |
| `/start write-spec story-id` | write-spec | Fetch story → analyze codebase → write Claude Instructions spec |
| `/start review-pr PR` | review-pr | Multi-perspective PR review against story requirements |
| `/start test-pr PR` | test-pr | Functional testing with evidence gathering |
| `/start start-debugging` | start-debugging | Debug-first workflow (describe bug → investigate → TDD fix) |
| `/start start-debugging story-id --rework` | start-debugging | Read story comments as rework items → fix → new PR |
| `/start create-story` | create-story | Interview user → draft story → submit to PM tool |
| `/start full-cycle [story-id\|description]` | full-cycle | Drive the whole lifecycle end to end: create-story → write-spec → start-development → review-pr → test-pr, looping until tests pass |

## Configuration

Create `~/.claude/dev-workflow/config.json`:

```json
{
  "pm_adapter": "shortcut",
  "notes_adapter": "obsidian",
  "adapters": {
    "obsidian": {
      "vault_path": "/path/to/your/vault",
      "prompts_dir": "Engineering/Prompts"
    },
    "local": {
      "specs_path": "docs/specs"
    },
    "shortcut": {
      "story_id_prefix": "sc-"
    }
  },
  "deploy_command": "Run the dev CI workflow in GitHub Actions"
}
```

The `local` notes adapter's `specs_path` is optional. When omitted, specs default to `docs/specs/` relative to the repo root. Set it to a relative path (resolved against the repo root) or an absolute path to store specs elsewhere.

## Adapters

**PM adapters** (`skills/pm-adapter/`): `shortcut`, `linear`, `github-issues`

**Notes adapters** (`skills/notes-adapter/`): `obsidian`, `local`

## Custom Adapters

You can override any built-in adapter or create a new one by placing a file in `~/.claude/skills/`:

- PM adapters: `~/.claude/skills/pm-adapter/{name}.md`
- Notes adapters: `~/.claude/skills/notes-adapter/{name}.md`

Set the matching name in your config:

```json
{
  "pm_adapter": "my-pm-tool",
  "notes_adapter": "my-notes-tool"
}
```

User adapters in `~/.claude/skills/` take precedence over plugin adapters with the same name. This means you can override a built-in adapter (e.g., create `~/.claude/skills/pm-adapter/shortcut.md` to customize Shortcut behavior) or add support for a new tool entirely.

Your adapter must implement the same interface as built-in adapters — see `skills/pm-adapter/interface.md` or `skills/notes-adapter/interface.md` for the required capabilities.

## Context Compaction (full-cycle only)

Long `full-cycle` runs accumulate context. Version 2.15.0 adds three mechanisms
to keep compaction lossless and, where possible, automatic:

**Checkpoints** — full-cycle writes `~/.claude/dev-workflow/state/{story-id}.json`
at every stage boundary and loop iteration. On re-invoke, the pipeline re-enters at
the correct stage regardless of when compaction occurred.

**Context meter** — a PostToolUse hook measures token usage against a fixed 200,000-token
baseline. At 60% it advises writing a checkpoint; at 75% it advises compacting at the
next handoff. Set `DEV_WORKFLOW_COMPACT_BASELINE` (tokens) to override the baseline.

**Compact injector** — a Stop hook fires at turn end. If a `.compact-request` sentinel
exists and the session is inside tmux, the hook spawns a detached process that injects
`/compact` into the pane and sends the resume command after compaction completes. Outside
tmux, full-cycle instead tells you the exact two commands to run manually.

Both hooks are registered automatically when the plugin is loaded.

# Notes Adapter Interface

A notes adapter tells you where to read/write implementation specs for stories.

## Configuration

Read `~/.claude/dev-workflow/config.json`. The `notes_adapter` field names which adapter to use.

## Required Capabilities

**1. Read spec** — given story ID and service name, return spec content (or "not found")

**2. Write spec** — given story ID, service name, and content, persist the spec

## Service name detection

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel | xargs basename
```

Run this to determine the current service name. Use it as part of the spec path.

## How to use

1. Read config to get `notes_adapter` value
2. Load adapter with user-override lookup:
   - First: Read `~/.claude/skills/notes-adapter/{notes_adapter}.md` — if found, use it (user override)
   - Fallback: load `skills/notes-adapter/{notes_adapter}.md` (plugin built-in)
   - If neither exists: STOP — "Notes adapter '{name}' not found. Check ~/.claude/dev-workflow/config.json and ensure ~/.claude/skills/notes-adapter/{name}.md exists or the name matches a built-in adapter."
3. Follow adapter's instructions for all read/write spec operations

## User Adapters

Place a file at `~/.claude/skills/notes-adapter/{name}.md` to create a custom adapter. Set `notes_adapter: "{name}"` in config.

User adapters take precedence over plugin adapters with the same name. This allows you to override any built-in adapter or create one for an unsupported notes tool.

Your adapter must implement the same interface: Read spec, Write spec.

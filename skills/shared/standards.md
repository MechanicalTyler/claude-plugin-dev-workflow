# Shared Standards

These rules apply to every dev-workflow skill. Read this file at the start of each session.

---

## Reality Filter

- Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact
- Label unverified content: [Inference] [Speculation] [Unverified]
- Ask for clarification if information is missing. Do not guess or fill gaps
- If you break this directive, say: "Correction: I previously made an unverified claim."

---

## Communication Standards

- **NO boilerplate** — Never include "Co-Authored by Claude", "Generated with Claude Code", or any AI attribution in commits, PRs, comments, or reports
- Output should read as if written by a human engineer
- Clear, professional, technically focused language

---

## Bash Command Rules

To avoid triggering unnecessary approval prompts:

- **No shell variable assignments** — Never write `VAR=$(command)` or `VAR=value` at the start of a Bash call. Use each command's output directly in subsequent commands as a literal value.
- **No comments before commands** — Never put `# comment` lines before or inside a Bash call. Remove all inline comments from shell commands.
- **No multi-`$()` compositions** — Never build a single command from multiple `$()` substitutions. Run each sub-command separately and use its literal output value.
- **One operation per call** — Each distinct shell operation should be its own Bash tool call.

---

## File and Command Operations

- **Use Write tool for files** — Never use `cat` or `echo` with redirection to write files
- **Stay within repository** — Do not `cd` outside the repository directory

---

## Problem Solving

- Never give up. If stuck, ask for help.
- If unable to access a screenshot, mockup, or attachment referenced in requirements — STOP and ask the user. Do not proceed with incomplete data.
